# EC200 GSM Module
In this project, we are going to see how to interface GSM Module(EC200) to USB to TTL(CP2102). So lets get to business!

A GSM(Global System for Mobile Communication) module is used to enable communication between microcontroller or microprocessor and GSM network.<br><br>
You can checkout the [Quectel Website](https://www.quectel.com/) for more details.<br><br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to connect a GSM module to USB to TTL(CP2102)!

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>
Here are direct links for same.<br>
* [Datasheet](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip) 
* [AT Command Manual](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip)
## Prerequisites
* [Realterm](https://realterm.sourceforge.io/index.html#downloads_Download) or any other serial terminal (Windows)
* minicom (Linux)
* USB to TTL (CP2102)
* EC200 EVB
* Jumpers
* Basic knowledge of UART and serial communication
## Connections
![Alt text](Images/Schematic_EC200_2022-04-21.png?raw=true "Title")
* Rx(EC200) ---> Tx(USB to TTL)
* Tx(EC200) ---> Rx(USB to TTL)
* Power Supply(5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
### Windows
* Connect the USB to TTL(CP2102) to USB port of PC and open device manager to check the port connected to serial bridge (USB to TTL).<br>
![Alt text](Images/deviceManager.png?raw=true "Title")
* Open Realterm or any other serial terminal you want to use.
* Open the port to which your serial device is connected make sure to check serial configuration as follows:<br>
   Baudrate : 115200<br>
   Data Bits : 8<br>
   Parity : None<br>
   Stopbits : 1<br> 
![Alt text](Images/serialConfig.PNG?raw=true "Title")
* That's it!!! Now you can send AT commands using realterm directly to GSM Module and also receive its response.
* Firstly check whether you receive ```OK``` in response to ```AT\r\n```, to make sure that your connections and configurations are fine.
* Now you can further proceed to other AT commands according to your application.
### Linux
First you need to install the minicom application
```
apt update
apt install minicom
```
In the next step, confirm the serial port address using the following command
```
demsg | grep tty
```
And try to open the app using the following command
```
minicom -s
```

## Basic AT Commands
1. Basic AT Command: ```AT\r\n```
2. Deactivate PDP Context: ```AT+QIDEACT=1\r\n```
3. Set APN: (according to network operator)
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"JIONET","","",0\r\n``` for JIO SIM
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"airtelgprs.com","","",0\r\n``` for Airtel SIM
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"portalnmms","","",0\r\n``` for Vodafone SIM
  * ```AT+QICSGP=1,1,"bsnlnet","","",0\r\n``` for Airtel SIM
4. Activate PDP Context: ```AT+QIACT=1\r\n``` 
5. Ping Google to check internet availability: ```AT+QPING=1,"www.google.com"\r\n```
